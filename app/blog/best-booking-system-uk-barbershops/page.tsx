          <section style={sectionStyle}>
            <h2 style={h2Style}>Barbering isn&apos;t what it was — and your booking shouldn&apos;t be either</h2>
            <p>
              The UK men&apos;s grooming market is on track to hit around £1.3 billion by 2026, and barbershops have shifted from cash-in-hand, walk-in-only shops into modern, client-focused businesses with online booking, loyalty and branded digital experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              That shift creates a specific problem: barbershops have needs most generic salon software wasn&apos;t built for. You&apos;re often juggling <strong style={{ color: C.text }}>walk-ins and booked appointments at the same time</strong>, tracking <strong style={{ color: C.text }}>several barbers&apos; takings separately</strong>, and offering fast, repeatable services — fades, beard trims, hot-towel shaves — where a no-show on a busy Saturday genuinely stings.
            </p>
            <p>
              So when you choose booking software, the question isn&apos;t &ldquo;which is most popular&rdquo; — it&apos;s &ldquo;which fits how my shop actually works.&rdquo;

          {/* Section 3 */}
          <section style={sectionStyle}>
            <h2 style={h2Style}>The honest bit: marketplace vs flat pricing</h2>
            <p>
              Here&apos;s where the big platforms differ most, and it matters for a barbershop&apos;s margins.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some platforms (like Booksy, around £40/month plus per-barber fees, or Fresha on its newer paid plans) run a <strong style={{ color: C.text }}>consumer marketplace</strong> — a client-facing app that can send you new customers, in exchange for a commission on those new bookings (Booksy&apos;s &ldquo;Boost&rdquo; takes 30% of a new client&apos;s first visit; Fresha takes 20% on new marketplace clients). If most of your growth comes from that marketplace, it can be worth it.
            </p>
            <p>
              But many barbershops grow through word of mouth, repeat regulars and their own Instagram — not a marketplace. If that&apos;s you, you may be paying commission for introductions you&apos;d have made anyway. In that case, a <strong style={{ color: C.text }}>flat-rate platform</strong> — one predictable monthly price, no cut of your bookings — usually works out better and far easier to budget.
            </p>
            <p>
              Per-barber pricing is the other thing to watch. A &ldquo;£27.50 for one barber&rdquo; headline can climb quickly once you add chairs and the add-ons (SMS, loyalty, marketing) that are often sold separately. Always work out the <em>all-in</em> monthly cost for your actual number of barbers before you commit.
            </p>
          </section>

          {/* Section 4 — Where Feature fits */}
          <section style={sectionStyle}>
            <h2 style={h2Style}>Where Feature fits</h2>
            <p>
              Feature is a UK-built booking platform with a deliberately simple model for barbershops that would rather have certainty than a commission bill:
            </p>

            <div style={{ background: C.surface, border: "1.5px solid rgba(201,162,75,0.3)", borderRadius: 16, padding: "20px 24px", margin: "20px 0", display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", gap: 14 }}>
              {FEATURE_POINTS.map((item, i) => (
                <div key={i} style={{ display: "flex", gap: 12, alignItems: "flex-start" }}>
                  <span style={{ color: "#10B981", fontWeight: 900, flexShrink: 0, fontSize: 16, marginTop: 3 }}>✓</span>
                  <span style={{ color: C.text2 }}>{item}</span>
                </div>
              ))}
            </div>

            <p>
              We&apos;ll be straight about the trade-off: Feature isn&apos;t a consumer marketplace, so it won&apos;t put your shop in front of strangers the way Booksy can. You bring your clients; in return, you keep 100% of what they spend and your cost never moves. For an established shop with a loyal chair, that&apos;s usually the better deal — but if marketplace discovery is your main growth engine, a marketplace platform may suit you better. That&apos;s the honest answer.
