            No-shows are one of the quietest, costliest problems in any salon. The good news: a few simple changes can cut them dramatically. Here&apos;s what actually works — backed by UK industry data.

          {/* Section 1 */}
          <section style={sectionStyle}>
            <h2 style={h2Style}>Why no-shows hurt more than they look</h2>
            <p>
              When a client doesn&apos;t turn up, you don&apos;t just lose that booking — you lose a slot you could have given to someone else, and the time your chair sat empty is gone for good. It adds up fast.
            </p>
            <p>
              The numbers tell the story. Across the UK beauty and salon industry, no-shows are estimated to cost businesses well over £1 billion a year, with each missed appointment averaging around £39 in lost revenue (Scratch Magazine). Industry no-show rates typically sit somewhere between 10% and 20% of appointments — that&apos;s potentially one in five chairs sitting empty when it shouldn&apos;t be.
            </p>
            <p>The encouraging part: this is one of the most fixable problems in your business.</p>
          </section>

          {/* Section 2 */}
          <section style={sectionStyle}>
            <h2 style={h2Style}>1. Send reminders clients actually read</h2>
            <p>
              Most no-shows aren&apos;t clients deciding not to come — they simply forget. A good reminder fixes that.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the channel matters. Email reminders are standard, yet plenty of clients never open them. Research consistently shows automated reminders cut no-shows meaningfully — online appointment reminders have been found to reduce no-shows by around 29%, and SMS reminders improve attendance significantly compared to no reminder at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              The single biggest upgrade most salons can make is reminding clients somewhere they&apos;ll definitely see it: <strong style={{ color: C.text }}>WhatsApp and SMS.</strong> People read their texts and WhatsApp messages within minutes; emails can sit unopened for days. A reminder 48 hours before (enough time to rebook the slot if they cancel) plus one on the morning of the appointment is a simple, effective rhythm.
            </p>
          </section>

          {/* Section 3 */}
          <section style={sectionStyle}>
            <h2 style={h2Style}>2. Take a small deposit on higher-value bookings</h2>
            <p>
              This is the most powerful lever of all. When a client has put money down, they&apos;re far more likely to show up — research shows salons that take deposits see no-shows drop by roughly 29%, and in some cases far more.
            </p>
            <p>
              You don&apos;t need to charge the full price. Even a small deposit — say 10–20% of the service — creates enough commitment to make a real difference, without scaring clients away. Many owners apply deposits only to longer or higher-value treatments, or to clients with a history of missing appointments.
            </p>
            <p>
              A nice side effect: clients who&apos;ve paid a deposit often spend a little more overall, because the final bill feels smaller.
            </p>
          </section>

          {/* Section 4 */}
          <section style={sectionStyle}>
            <h2 style={h2Style}>3. Make your policy clear — and visible</h2>
            <p>
              A cancellation policy only works if clients know about it before they book. Put it where they&apos;ll see it: on your booking page, in the confirmation message, and in reminders. Something simple like &ldquo;Please give us 24 hours&apos; notice to cancel or reschedule&rdquo; sets a fair expectation without feeling harsh.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal isn&apos;t to punish people — it&apos;s to gently signal that your time has value, which on its own nudges behaviour.
            </p>
          </section>

          {/* Section 5 */}
          <section style={sectionStyle}>
            <h2 style={h2Style}>4. Let clients book (and rebook) online</h2>
            <p>
              It might sound counterintuitive, but clients who book online tend to miss fewer appointments than those who book by phone or in person — partly because they get an instant confirmation and automated reminders, and partly because rescheduling is easy. When changing an appointment is a two-tap job rather than an awkward phone call, clients reschedule instead of simply not showing up.
            </p>
          </section>

          {/* Section 6 */}
          <section style={sectionStyle}>
            <h2 style={h2Style}>5. Fill the gap when someone does cancel</h2>
            <p>
              No system gets you to zero no-shows. So have a plan for the empty slot: a waitlist of clients who&apos;d happily come in sooner, or a quick message to regulars when a prime slot opens up. A cancellation that gets refilled costs you nothing.
            </p>
          </section>

          {/* Section 7 */}
          <section style={sectionStyle}>
            <h2 style={h2Style}>Putting it together</h2>
            <p>
              The salons that beat no-shows rarely do just one thing. The combination that works is consistent: <strong style={{ color: C.text }}>online booking, automatic WhatsApp/SMS reminders, a clear cancellation policy, and deposits on higher-value treatments.</strong> Owners who put all of these in place often see their no-show rate fall by more than half.
            </p>
            <p>
              None of it requires a bigger team — just the right system doing the chasing for you.
