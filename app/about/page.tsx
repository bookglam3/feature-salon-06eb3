            Feature didn&apos;t start as a tech company. It started with a family salon &mdash; and the quiet chaos most salon owners know too well.
          </p>
          <p style={prose}>
            We watched it up close. Bookings scattered across a phone, a notebook, and a flood of DMs. Clients who forgot they&apos;d booked. Empty chairs that should have been full. Evenings spent chasing payments and confirming tomorrow&apos;s appointments one message at a time.
          </p>
          <p style={prose}>
            And then there were the tools that were supposed to help. They didn&apos;t feel like they were on our side. The &ldquo;free&rdquo; platforms quietly took a cut of every booking. The fees crept up. The bigger they got, the less they seemed to care about the small business that made them money in the first place.
          </p>
          <p style={prose}>
            So we asked a simple question: why does software built for salons so often work against them?
